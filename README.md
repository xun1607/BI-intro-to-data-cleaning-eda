🔑 Insights
Entry scores are not always a predictor of success.
High study hours do not guarantee better performance → quality over quantity.
Students with higher degrees may still fail if background is unrelated.
Need for personalized learning approaches rather than one-size-fits-all.

🚀 Next Steps
Develop predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to forecast student performance.
Implement an early-warning system to flag at-risk students.
Explore advanced visualizations and dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
